Drone controlled by on-board Android smartphone

# Development in progress
The repository is a bit of a mess right now.  Check back soon for a cleaner layout and a more detailed README.

# Supporting off-robot nodes
1. geometry_msgs/Twist publisher (We used hector_quadrotor_teleop with a DualShock4 joystick).
2. sensor_msgs/Imu data viewer (Will soon be uploaded to the jeremyroy/simone_remote repository)
